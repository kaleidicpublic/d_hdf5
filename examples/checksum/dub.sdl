description "\n\t\tBased on h5ex_d_checksum.c\n\t\t  This example shows how to read and write data to a dataset\n\t\t  using the Fletcher32 checksum filter.  The program first\n\t\t  checks if the Fletcher32 filter is available, then if it\n\t\t  is it writes integers to a dataset using Fletcher32, then\n\t\t  closes the file.  Next, it reopens the file, reads back\n\t\t  the data, checks if the filter detected an error and\n\t\t  outputs the type of filter and the maximum value in the\n\t\t  dataset to the screen.\n\t"
