description "\n  This example shows how to create and extend an unlimited\n  dataset.  The program first writes integers to a dataset\n  with dataspace dimensions of DIM0xDIM1, then closes the\n  file.  Next, it reopens the file, reads back the data,\n  outputs it to the screen, extends the dataset, and writes\n  new data to the extended portions of the dataset.  Finally\n  it reopens the file again, reads back the data, and\n  outputs it to the screen.\n"
