description "illustrates the usage of the H5A Interface functions: based on h5_attribute.c\n\n  This example shows how to read and write a complex\n  compound datatype to a dataset.  The program first writes\n  complex compound structures to a dataset with a dataspace\n  of DIM0, then closes the file.  Next, it reopens the file,\n  reads back selected fields in the structure, and outputs\n  them to the screen.\n\n  Unlike the other datatype examples, in this example we\n  save to the file using native datatypes to simplify the\n  type definitions here.  To save using standard types you\n  must manually calculate the sizes and offsets of compound\n  types as shown in h5ex_t_cmpd.c, and convert enumerated\n  values as shown in h5ex_t_enum.c.\n\n  The datatype defined here consists of a compound\n  containing a variable-length list of compound types, as\n  well as a variable-length string, enumeration, double\n  array, object reference and region reference.  The nested\n  compound type contains an int, variable-length string and\n  two doubles.\n*/\t"
