name "select"
description "\n\t*  This program shows how the H5Sselect_hyperslab and H5Sselect_elements\n *  functions are used to write selected data from memory to the file.\n *  Program takes 48 elements from the linear buffer and writes them into\n *  the matrix using 3x2 blocks, (4,3) stride and (2,4) count.\n *  Then four elements  of the matrix are overwritten with the new values and\n *  file is closed. Program reopens the file and selects the union of two\n *  hyperslabs in the dataset in the file. Then it reads the selection into the\n *  memory dataset preserving the shape of the selection.\n*"
