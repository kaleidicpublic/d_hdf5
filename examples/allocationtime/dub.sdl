description "\n\t\tBased on h5ex_d_alloc.c\n\t\t  This example shows how to set the space allocation time\n\t\t  for a dataset.  The program first creates two datasets,\n\t\t  one with the default allocation time (late) and one with\n\t\t  early allocation time, and displays whether each has been\n\t\t  allocated and their allocation size.  Next, it writes data\n\t\t  to the datasets, and again displays whether each has been\n\t\t  allocated and their allocation size."
