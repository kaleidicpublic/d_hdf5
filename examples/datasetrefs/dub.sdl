description "\n\t This program shows how to create, store and dereference references\n    to the dataset regions.\n\n    It creates a file and writes a two dimensional integer dataset\n    to it. Then it creates a dataset to store region references in. It\n    stores references to a hyperslab and 3 points selected (for the\n    integer dataset previously created).\n\n    It then reopens the references dataset, reads and dereferences the\n    region references, and then reads and displays the selected hyperslab\n    and selected elements data from the integer dataset.\n"
