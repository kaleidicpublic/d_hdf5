description "\n\t  This example demonstrates how the data transform features of\n  HDF5 works.\n \n  (1)\n   The test first writes out data, with no data transform set.\n   Then, the test reads back this data with a data transform applied.\n \n  (2)\n   Then, the test writes a new set of data, with a data transform set.\n   Then, the test reads this new set of data, without a data set.\n \n  (3)\n   Lastly, the test reads the previous set of data (that was written out\n   with a data transform) with a data transform set for the read.\n \n   (4)\n   Get the transform from the property using H5Pget_data_transform.\n"
