description "\n\tBased on h5ex_d_chunk.c\n\t    This example shows how to create a chunked dataset.  The\n\t    program first writes integers in a hyperslab selection to\n\t    a chunked dataset with dataspace dimensions of DIM0xDIM1\n\t    and chunk size of CHUNK0xCHUNK1, then closes the file.\n\t    Next, it reopens the file, reads back the data, and\n\t    outputs it to the screen.  Finally it reads the data again\n\t    using a different hyperslab selection, and outputs\n\t    the result to the screen.\n    "
