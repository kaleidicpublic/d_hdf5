description "\n\tBased on h5ex_t_bit.c\n\t\tThis example shows how to read and write bitfield\n\t\tdatatypes to a dataset.  The program first writes bit\n\t\tfields to a dataset with a dataspace of DIM0xDIM1, then\n\t\tcloses the file.  Next, it reopens the file, reads back\n\t\tthe data, and outputs it to the screen.\n\t"
